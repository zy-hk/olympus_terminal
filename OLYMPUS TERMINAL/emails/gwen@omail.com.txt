problem fixed. as i was saying, its a bit sad when ive done something that i think is quite impressive and im proud of but cant really sahfre with anyone because a, whatsapp exists, and b, its stuck to my computer, and c, its very impractical, and inmportantly d, its ok impressive enough for my age but only for length of code not ability of code like its literally rly basic shit but im still lowkey proud of it? idk. would probably be quite impressive if it was the year 2000 and i made it into a website
